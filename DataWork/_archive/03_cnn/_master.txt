# Extract daytime imagery to OPM locations. Creates a (1) numpy array with daytime imagery
# values around each survey location and a (2) pandas dataframe with the uid of each survey
# location, in the same order as the numpy array.

# Extract daytime and nighttime lights data for CNN. Nighttime lights is originally at about
# a 1x1km resolution and daytime is at a 30m resolution. Creates numpy arrays for both daytime and nighttime imagery values. For each observation, nighttime imagery contains one value (the value of nighttime lights) and daytime imagery contains a stacked matrix of values
